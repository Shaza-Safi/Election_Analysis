## Overview of Election Audit:
### Overview and Purpose of Project:
In this project We will help Tom who is a Colorado Board of Elections employee to perform an election audit on the tabulated results of US Congressional precinct in Colorado.

### Source of Data 
There are three primary voting methods that were taken into account in the audit.
1- Mail-in Ballots
2- Punch Cards
3- Direct Recording Electronic
The votes cast by these three methods were used to determine the final election results.

After running the Python script results will be immediatly printed into a text file as follows: 


## Election Audit Summary:
After looking at the outcomes of the election audit and how using Python to pull and process data to give reliable outcomes in a tabulated form i must say it is a very efficient, relaiable and defintely recommendable tool to be used for analysis. I must also say that we can use this script in other election audits with two recommended modifications as follows:
- Results to show the candidate with the most votes in each county. I would creat a new variable for candidates of each county and do a loop on it.
- Consolidate the print command to have both the candidate and the county and edit the script accordingly.
